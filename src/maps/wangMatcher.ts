/**
 * Native corner Wang matching, so that painting terrain does not require the
 * Tiled CLI to be installed.
 *
 * The CLI path (`terrainPaint.ts`) drives Tiled's own `TileLayer.wangEdit()`
 * and is the parity reference. This module reimplements the corner case of
 * that matcher in-process, which is what walls need: paint the corners of a
 * region and let each cell pick the tile whose corner colours agree with its
 * neighbours.
 *
 * ## The one deliberate divergence
 *
 * Tiled's `WangFiller` chooses *randomly*, weighted by `probability`, among
 * tiles that match a pattern equally well. This server forbids `Math.random`
 * and wall-clock in generators -- the same input must always produce the same
 * bytes -- so where Tiled would roll a die, this picks the lowest local tile
 * id. The result is always a tile Tiled would consider valid for that corner
 * pattern; on a set with several equally-good candidates it is not necessarily
 * the same one a given CLI run produced.
 *
 * ## What it refuses
 *
 * Where no tile in the set matches a required corner pattern, this fails
 * closed and names the cell, rather than approximating with a near-match.
 * That is the house stance and it matters more here than usual: a silently
 * wrong wall tile is exactly the kind of defect that survives review.
