An MCP server for [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org) map projects. A model can read,
edit, generate, render, and validate `.tmj` / `.tsj` assets on disk without opening the
editor.

Two rules govern the design:

- **Writes go preview → approval → apply.** A tool returns a change set, your client
  shows the bounded summary to a human, and a second call commits it under a revision
  guard. `tiled_create_map` and `tiled_create_checkpoint` are the only exceptions.
- **Undefined semantics fail closed.** Where Tiled 1.12.2's own behavior is ambiguous or
  unimplemented, the server errors instead of approximating.

## Quickstart

Node.js 22.15+ is the only requirement. Everything runs on a built-in JSON and PNG
path; installing Tiled later unlocks two extra tools.

**1. Pick a project folder.** Any directory holding your `.tmj` maps, `.tsj` tilesets,
and tile images will do, as will an empty one you want maps created in. The server
treats it as a hard sandbox and never touches anything outside it.

**2. Connect your client.**

Claude Code needs no path; the server sandboxes itself to the project you have open
(via [MCP roots](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/client/roots)):

```bash
claude mcp add tiled -- npx -y tiled-mcp-pro
```

Codex CLI:

```bash
codex mcp add tiled -- npx -y tiled-mcp-pro --project-dir /absolute/path/to/your/tiled-project
```

Gemini CLI:

```bash
gemini mcp add tiled npx -y tiled-mcp-pro --project-dir /absolute/path/to/your/tiled-project
```

VS Code:

```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"tiled","command":"npx","args":["-y","tiled-mcp-pro","--project-dir","/absolute/path/to/your/tiled-project"]}'
```

For Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, or any other JSON-configured client, the same
`mcpServers` entry works in `claude_desktop_config.json`, `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, and
`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tiled": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tiled-mcp-pro", "--project-dir", "/absolute/path/to/your/tiled-project"]
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The first `npx` run downloads the package, so the first connection takes a moment;
> after that it starts from the cache.

To poke at the tools by hand instead, use the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx -y tiled-mcp-pro --project-dir /absolute/path/to/your/tiled-project
```

**3. Try it.** Drop a tilesheet PNG into the project folder and ask your assistant to
*"build a map from tiles/sheet.png — tiles are 16×16"*, or invoke the
`create_map_from_tilesheet` prompt, which carries the whole sequence. The model renders
the sheet with every tile labeled by its local ID and picks tiles by looking at them.
Every edit comes back as a preview you approve before the server writes anything.

## Status

> [!WARNING]
> Version 0.2.0. The interface is a draft and is not frozen.

53 tools register: 51 core, plus 2 that appear only when the server detects Tiled or
`tmxrasterizer` on PATH (`tiled_render_map`, `tiled_preview_export`). Everything else,
including `tiled_preview_terrain` and `tiled_preview_automap`, runs on the built-in
JSON and PNG path with no external binary. The suite is 1,587 passing tests across
128 files.

## Configuration

Transport is stdio. stdout carries MCP protocol only; diagnostics go to stderr.

The project sandbox resolves in order: `--project-dir`, then `TILED_PROJECT_DIR`, then
the client's first MCP root (Claude Code advertises your working directory). If none of
the three yields a directory, startup fails closed rather than guessing a root.
Whatever supplies it, the sandbox is hard: the server rejects paths outside it and
symlinks, and the root stays fixed for the life of the session (later `roots/list_changed`
notifications do not move it).

| Flag | Environment variable | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--checkpoint-bytes N` | `TILEDMCP_CHECKPOINT_BYTES` | 1 GiB of retained checkpoint storage |
| `--checkpoint-retain-per-target N` | `TILEDMCP_CHECKPOINT_RETAIN_PER_TARGET` | off; `2..10000` turns on rolling retention |

CLI wins over environment. Read the values in force from
`tiled_get_capabilities.checkpointCapabilities`.

## What it does

**Read.** Map summaries, bounded regions (a run-length `gids` format, one
`"0*12,364,0*48"` string per row, keeps large reads compact in a model's context),
atlas and image-collection tileset details,
Wang set expansion, object and template reads, usage analysis, four-way connectivity
analysis, and coordinate conversion across all four projections. TMX/TSX/TX parse through
a zero-dependency restricted parser, read-only. JSON worlds list read-only.

**Edit.** `tiled_preview_edits` carries 17 operations: `setTiles`, `fillRegion`,
`stampPattern`, `floodFill`, `copyRegion`, `replaceTiles`, `createObject`,
`updateObject`, `deleteObjects`, `updateLayer`, `deleteLayer`, `moveLayer`,
`duplicateLayer`, `updateMap`, `resizeMap`, `transcodeTileLayer`, and
`removeTilesetFromMap`. Separate preview tools handle tileset writes
(`tiled_update_tile`, `tiled_update_tileset`, `tiled_update_wangsets`), layer and tileset
creation, file deletion, project class/enum definitions, and a semantic tile-name
registry.

**Generate.** Deterministic shape brushes, value noise, cellular caves,
rooms-and-corridors dungeons, weighted scatter, reference-image import, multi-layer
prefab stamping, and a native port of Tiled's AutoMapping rule engine. The same seed
yields the same bytes; the codebase has no `Math.random`.

**Render.** Native PNG output for orthogonal, isometric, staggered, hexagonal, and
oblique maps;
tileset sheets; sparse tile selections; tile-layer previews with grid, coordinate,
highlight, and object-debug overlays; pixel-level render diff. `tmxrasterizer` handles
full-fidelity whole-map PNGs when it is installed.

**Write XML.** Byte-exact TMX/TSX/TX output checked against Tiled 1.12.2's own writer,
including class properties serialized through `.tiled-project` definitions.

**Recover.** Content-addressed checkpoints with startup reconciliation, cross-file
transactions that survive a crash mid-write, and restore that rebuilds a deleted file
byte for byte.

## The editing loop

1. Read `revision`, `dependencyRevisions`, and tileset `assetId` from
   `tiled_get_map_summary` or a region read.
2. Pass both revision pins and your operations to `tiled_preview_edits`.
3. Show the returned bounded summary to the user for approval.
4. Call `tiled_apply_change_set` with the `changeSetId` and `expectedRevision`.

Tiles are addressed as `{"tileset":{"kind":"external","assetId":"…"},"localId":0}`;
callers never touch raw GIDs. A preview refuses to issue if the map or any pinned
dependency has moved.

The `tiled://guide` resource walks the same loop with worked call sequences.

## Errors

A handler result wraps as `{"result": <success payload>}`. Domain errors set
`isError: true` and return
`{"result":{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"…","message":"…","details":{}}}}`. Branch on
`structuredContent.result.error.code` alone. Messages and `details` fields carry no
stability guarantee.

107 application codes ship in
[`contracts/application-errors.v1.json`](contracts/application-errors.v1.json) and at the
`tiled://application-errors` resource. `INTERNAL_ERROR` is the fallback for unexpected
handler failures. v1 identifiers keep their meaning, but new codes can appear: treat an
unknown code as a generic application error and refresh discovery.

The registry excludes MCP SDK input errors, `cli.*.issues[].code` probe diagnostics,
startup fatals, `tiled_validate` diagnostics, checkpoint reconciliation diagnostics, and
raw OS error codes. Those surfaces each follow their own contract. Input that the SDK
schema rejects before it reaches a handler returns text only, with no
`structuredContent`.

## Resources

| URI | Type | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `tiled://guide` | `text/markdown` | capability discovery, sheet and preview inspection, change-set approval, commit, post-commit re-check |
| `tiled://application-errors` | `application/json` | the 107-code v1 registry with wire location and compatibility rules |

One resource template registers: `tiled://guide/{section}` serves a single guide
section by the slug listed in the guide's Contents block. Trust `resources/list` and
`resources/templates/list` over this table.

## Prompts

A tool list cannot tell an agent which eight of the fifty-three calls to make, or in
what order. These prompts carry the sequence:

| Prompt | Start here when |
|---|---|
| `create_map_from_tilesheet` | you have a tilesheet image and no map yet |
| `build_from_floor_plan` | you have a map, a tileset, and a floor-plan image to turn into a room |
| `set_up_tile_roles` | you want later edits to say `{"name": "wall_brick"}` instead of a local id |
| `review_map` | you want a read-only report and no changes |

Each names exact tools in exact order and restates the invariants that decide whether a
first call succeeds: revision pinning, `TileRef` rather than raw GIDs, preview before
apply. `create_map_from_tilesheet` also calls out the three things that fail a cold
start: no tool creates parent directories, a newly created map has no layer to paint
into, and the dependency pin stops being empty the moment you attach a tileset.

[`fixtures/mvp/basic.tmj`](fixtures/mvp/basic.tmj) opens and renders in Tiled 1.12.2. Its
external TSJ carries tile classes, properties, a collision object group, and a Wang set,
which pins the detail-read and tile-search contracts.

## Development

```bash
pnpm verify   # typecheck, build, contract check, full test suite
```

`pnpm contract:generate` rebuilds both machine contracts and the generated reference from
real `tools/list`, `resources/list`, `resources/templates/list`, and `resources/read`
responses across the two capability profiles. It never probes PATH or launches Tiled.
`pnpm contract:check` diffs the regenerated artifacts against what is committed and
re-validates all 53 examples against their public input schemas. `pnpm test` runs that
drift gate, builds `dist/`, then runs the suite including a real production stdio smoke
test. `pnpm test:watch` skips the stdio test to avoid a stale build; run
`pnpm test:stdio` to rebuild and re-run it alone.

With Tiled 1.12.2 and its bundled `tmxrasterizer` installed:

```bash
pnpm run verify:tiled-1.12.2
```

That is the same `pnpm verify` gate with `TILEDMCP_REQUIRE_TILED_1_12_2=1`: every test
that cross-checks the real Tiled CLI (version, runtime export formats, JSON round-trip
and PNG rasterization of checked-in fixtures, Tiled re-exporting what `tiled_create_map`
produced) turns from a skip into a hard failure when the CLI is missing or wrong. Point
at a non-standard install with `TILED_CLI_PATH` / `TILED_RASTERIZER_PATH`. Plain
`pnpm test` never makes the optional Tiled CLI a runtime dependency of the core
direct-JSON path.

### Evaluations

`evals/` holds question-and-answer suites for measuring whether a model can drive
this server, each answered against a committed fixture:

| Suite | Fixture | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `evals/floor-plan.xml` | `fixtures/floorplan/` | orthogonal map, image import, tile classes and roles, one Wang set |
| `evals/iso-town.xml` | `fixtures/isotown/` | isometric map, group-nested tile layers, GID flip flags, animated tile, every object shape |

Every answer is ground truth computed from the fixture bytes. Each suite has a test
that recomputes every answer and fails if the two disagree: an evaluation whose answers
have drifted reports a correct model as wrong, which is worse than no evaluation at all.
`tests/isoTownEval.test.ts` also reads its fixture back through the real service,
so the questions cannot outlive the reads they depend on.

Regenerate a fixture with `pnpm tsx scripts/generate-floorplan-fixture.ts` or
`pnpm tsx scripts/generate-isotown-fixture.ts`.

## Limits

- **Byte preservation.** Tile edits rewrite only the affected layer's `data`; object
  edits rewrite only `objects`, plus `nextobjectid` on create. BOM, line endings,
  indentation, key order, and number lexemes survive outside that scope. Replacing an
  array reformats it.
- **Projections.** Staggered and hexagonal support summary, region, usage, select, and
  render; edits fail closed. Isometric and oblique (Tiled 1.12+, the skewx/skewy shear)
  are open for edits and for every procedural planner; oblique also creates via
  `tiled_create_map` and renders with tmxrasterizer-verified placement. A degenerate
  oblique shear (`skewx*skewy == tilewidth*tileheight`) fails closed everywhere.
- **TMX and XML.** Reads never reach an edit planner. Writes create a new file in the
  same directory, no-replace, restricted profile. Enum-annotated members and
  out-of-profile structure fail closed, and class properties need an explicit
  `projectFilePath`.
- **Templates.** JSON `.tj` templates read, expand, and instantiate. Tile templates, XML
  templates, and nested templates fail closed.
- **Selections.** Pure data with no `selectionId` and no server-side state. `sampleLimit`
  reaches 10,000 to match the `setTiles` cell budget, so a whole selection feeds straight
  into an edit.
- **Tile names.** `.tiledmcp/tile-names.json` is weak metadata. Reads pin each tileset's
  revision but report `localId` verbatim without re-checking tileset contents.
- **Consistency.** Every multi-file read reports
  `snapshotConsistency: "non-atomic-read-set"`. Read it as a disclosure; it makes no
  atomicity claim. `locked: true` is advisory metadata and blocks nothing.
- **AutoMapping.** `tiled_preview_automap` runs Tiled 1.9+ rules (rules.txt or a single
  rules map) through a native, deterministic port of the 1.12.2 rule engine: seeded
  randomness, tile-layer outputs only, fail-closed on the rest. Native because headless
  `--evaluate` cannot reach official AutoMapping in 1.12.2: `tiled.open()` needs the
  editor and `MapFormat.read()` maps are detached, which `autoMap()` rejects (evidence
  and source citations in `docs/02-mcp-spec.md` §10; `tests/automapCanary.test.ts`
  re-probes the installed Tiled and fails the day upstream lifts the restriction, at
  which point a CLI cross-check becomes possible).
- **Out of scope.** Any force path that modifies or deletes project assets, and a
  persistent prefab library with name matching.
